      "paraph1": "As your plane begins its downwind descent into Denver, you ponder the grayscale sunset from your window seat. It's been a week since the Earth's prismatic spectrum scattered into a million shades of gray. A tragedy, to be sure, but you also admire its underlying beauty. Maybe, without colors, people might grow less focused on each other's differences? There's some good in that, you muse silently as the sunset dims.",
      "paraph2": "But this is no time for idle thoughts. You're here on an undercover mission, posing as a 2017 ETHDenver attendee, to uncover the truth behind...The Dimmening.",
      "paraph3": "The leading theory? The decentralized rendering system in charge of displaying Earth's colors is under Sybil attack. Renowned cryptographic experts cite overwhelming evidence that an unidentified malicious actor executed a distributed denial of service attack on our planet's operating system. The origin? North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) located ninety miles south in Colorado Springs.",
      "paraph4": "The widespread belief across the country is that when the airport was first built, aliens — in league with nefarious conspiracy groups — built a backdoor to the underground chambers beneath the airport. Now, experts believe those aliens used this backdoor to access the tunnels leading to NORAD and take down the planet's foremost air defense system in preparation for an invasion by their species, for whom color is toxic.",
      "paraph5": "Coming from the metaverse where you have interacted with hundreds of species from nearby galaxies and star systems, you question the apocalyptic nature of this theory. Aliens and humans have long been friends in the metaverse. What's more is that something just doesn't add up: some of the artwork at the airport mysteriously retained its full spectrum while the rest of the world lost its colors.",
      "paraph6": "There is more nuance to this story than meets the eye, and you must uncover the truth.",

      "paraph1": "You finally made it. After a year of intense travel, life-changing encounters, breathtaking explorations, devastating depeggings, and unexpected insolvencies, you reached the Garden of Consent, home to what is known as the only cross-universe bridge between Earth and the vast realms of the open metaverse.",
      "paraph2": "Thanks to your intrepid detective work, the bridge’s location in Ethereum Valley is now widely known, but crossing it is reserved for a select few. Equipped with the correct soulbound tokens and verifiable credentials as a reward for solving The Dimmening at ETHDenver, you happen to be one of the few. But as always, things are more complicated than they seem.",
      "paraph3": "Once you reach the bridge, you discover that it is under construction. On-site workers inform you that the bridge is migrating from a Proof of Work to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism to address the scalability issues and accessibility concerns of the current system — which is why so few have been able to cross the bridge in the first place. This work should have been completed years ago, but the engineers at the Garden of Consent have reached an impasse.",
      "paraph4": "Akin to changing a plane’s engine mid-flight, the transition to Proof of Stake is not only complex, but perilous as well. To finalize the transition, the Garden’s developers need a hash hidden in the most remote corners of the metaverse. This is a mandatory piece of the migration to ensure backward compatibility that will correctly tie to the future timeline to the past.",
      "paraph5": "The issue? Once you cross the bridge into the metaverse, the only way to walk back is with that hash. Not finding it means staying stuck in the digital world forever. Who would be crazy enough to do that?",

    "nftParis": {
      "paraph1": "You put on the helmet you'd been building and switched it on. At first, everything was blank, and then you found yourself standing in the middle of Paris on a cobblestone street pulsating with the energy of the French Renaissance. It was 1717, just 80 years (or 4.2 million blocks) after Descartes released his Discourse On the Method white paper to the Cryptography Mailing List. Your plan was to hang out in this space-time, make some new friends, and gain a deeper understanding of this fascinating period in France's history.",
      "paraph2": "That was a month ago, and today, on a rainy Sunday morning, you are seated at your usual table in a literary salon in downtown Paris, taking notes on the white paper, journaling, and daydreaming about censorship-resistant cryptographic systems — as you often do.",
      "paraph3": "The sound of your name unexpectedly pierces your reverie and calls you to attention. It's your old friend from meatspace. She's been borrowing the helmet you built and teleporting to all sorts of periods in Earth's timeline, exploring the vast expanse of possibilities available to kids everywhere and everywhen.",
      "paraph4": "\"Aku!\" she screams as she approaches. You haven't seen her in a while — nor have you ever seen her this excited. \"I knew it! The portal exists! It's not just a legend,\" she exclaims breathlessly as she begins recounting her story.",
      "paraph5": "During a leisurely afternoon spent farming and harvesting in the beautiful lands of Ethereum Valley in 2888, her mind wandered to the white paper. Then, she had a stroke of genius: could the white paper hold the key to the metaverse?",
      "paraph6": "You see, until now, the helmet had been the only way to travel between the two realms. But legend had it that a portal exists that could democratize metaverse access for all — no special headgear required! Could the white paper hold a clue?",
      "paraph7": "She dropped the vegetables, pulled up the white paper in her helmet screen, and there it was: hidden in its pages was a clue to what could be the first step in locating that mythical gateway bridging the metaverse and the physical world.",
      "paraph8": "She has no concrete plan, no direction, and not even the vaguest idea what to do next. But in her excitement, it dawns on you that finding this bridge is a mission you must undertake together. No more sitting around in stylish cafés navel gazing about a better future. After all, who comes to 17th-century Paris and resists the call to an epic adventure for the benefit of humanity?",
