The contribution process is still in its early stages, so we're still working on the best way to contribute.
We're happy to receive feedback and suggestions, and we'll be happy to work with you to make Lighthouse better.

## Requirements

We recommend that you run this project on top of the production API of Lighthouse. If you have access to the development

streamlined so that anyone can build on top of the development API.
